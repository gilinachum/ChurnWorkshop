# ChurnWorkshop

**This workshop will provide you a 2 hours experience into the work of data scientists.**

It's a fun hands-on workshop on how to solve a customer churn problem (classification problem) for a cellular company using an XGBoost Algorithm on the SageMaker platform.
You'll be completing relevant code segements by checking the API documentation online.

## We’ll Cover: 
short intro into machine learning and the AWS AI/ML stack, working with hosted Jupyer notebooks as hosted Sagemaker notebooks, Numpy/Pandas API, data preperations, hosted training, parallel model tuning, online inference in production endpoint and batch inference jobs.

## Required knowledge?
basic python. 
Optionally, visit here to learn a bit on the SageMaker platform: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQc8Itd4UTs&list=PLhr1KZpdzukcOr_6j_zmSrvYnLUtgqsZz

## What you'll takeaway
You’ll experience the data scientist methodology and tools, and understand what's required to take an existing use case example, and adjust it to your use case.
